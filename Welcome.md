# Welcome to BUS-Z 798!

Hi Connor,

Welcome to BUS-Z 798!

It looks like you have your GitHub account set up correctly and have successfully shared it with me. I look forward to working with you this semester!

## GitHub
GitHub is a great tool for collaborating on projects. Right now it's very commonly used in the tech industry, but it's becoming more popular in research as well. As we'll discuss in class, GitHub is great for:

1. *Version control* - no more "final_paper_v2_final_final.docx"!

2. *Collaboration* - you can work with others on the same project, and GitHub will help you merge your changes together while minimizing overwriting of others' work. You can also see who made what changes and when. So if something got overwritten by one of your collaborators, you can easily go back to a previous version.

3. *Transparancy and Sharing* - you can share your code and data with others, and they can easily download it and use it. You can also share your work with the world, and get feedback from others. From an Open Science perspective, this is great because it allows others to reproduce your work and build on it.

We're not even going to scratch the surface of what is possible with GitHub in this class, but I hope you'll see the value of it and continue to use it in your future work.

If you're interested in learning more advanced features of GitHub, I recommend checking out [GitHub's guides](https://guides.github.com/) and introductory Youtube videos. If you're using GitHub SCM (using the terminal for everything), [this tutorial](https://learngitbranching.js.org/?locale=en_US) is how I learned Git and you might find it helpful as well. Unfortunately, I'm unaware of a similar tutorial for GitHub Desktop, but I'm sure there are some out there, and there are a bunch of YouTube videos ([for example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaqVvXv6zrU)).

Best,

Aaron
